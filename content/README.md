# Exploring modern DevOps

This repository is built as a resource to begin exploring GitHub and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps). Working through either a [guided workshop](./guided-workshop/) or a [challenge-based approach](./what-the-hack/Student/), you will learn the core concepts of DevOps and features available on GitHub to support you.

The workshop is centered around an application (included in this repository) written using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) backend, and the beginnings of end-to-end testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). You can use this repository as a template for creating your own projects, or walk through the available workshop and resources.

## Getting started with DevOps and GitHub

[GitHub is built on GitHub](./how-github-uses-github.md). We use [GitHub Actions](./automation.md) for [automation](./guided-workshop/resources/automation.md). We use [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/features/security) to secure the development pipeline. We use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to [write code](./guided-workshop/exercises/3-codespaces.md). And we use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) as an AI pair programmer. You can learn more about how we use [GitHub](./guided-workshop/resources/how-github-uses-github.md) to create GitHub and manage our DevOps processes, and begin exploring the features available. You can also gain hands-on experience by completing the workshops highlighted below.

## Workshop formats

### Step-by-step guided workshop

If you prefer a more guided experience, you can work through the [step-by-step workshop](./guided-workshop/). The workshop contains step-by-step instructions to complete the tasks and supporting information to learn more about the technology.

### Challenge-based

Many learners find the best results if they explore technology by performing the tasks without step-by-step instructions. To support this style, we have built a workshop using a format modeled from Microsoft's What the Hack. A set of challenges is provided in the [Student folder](./what-the-hack/Student/), where you begin by first opening the project and progressing through a set of tasks typical of a developer using DevOps processes. Solution files and other tips are available in the [Coach folder](./what-the-hack/Coach/), including a couple of [resource files](./what-the-hack/Coach/resources).
