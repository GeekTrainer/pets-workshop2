# Modern development and DevOps with GitHub: Setup

[Home](../readme.md) - [Next >](challenge01.md)

## Scenario

The shelter has an application already created by a vendor they wish to use as the foundation for their website. The project currently resides on GitHub as a template. The first step is for you to obtain the source code and create a repository on GitHub to maintain a separate copy. The changes you make will **not** be merged back to the original application.

The project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/) project using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). It is based on the [Next.js MongoDB example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mongodb).

> **IMPORTANT**: This hackathon does **not** require experience with JavaScript, React or Next.js.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have logged into [GitHub](https://github.com) with the credentials you will use for this hack.
1. Ensure you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, speak with one of the mentors or [create a free trial Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) to confirm that you have an active subscription.
