# Challenge 2 - Add a feature to the existing application - Coach's guide

## Notes and guidance

- Students **do not** need coding experience. If they are unfamiliar with code, they can copy/paste from the [provided Hours.js file](../Student/resources/Hours.js).
- Ensure students install the [Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) for their Codespace. This can also be done by registering it in the devcontainer.json file.
