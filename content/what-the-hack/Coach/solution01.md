# Challenge 1 - Configure your development environment - Coach's guide

## Notes and guidance

- Students **do not** need to install any resources on their local system. The challenge uses Codespaces, which is a cloud-based development container.
- Rebuilding the container after it's been configured for the project may take several minutes. Highlight how [prebuilds](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces) can ensure a Codespace is available for developers within seconds.
- Ensure attendees have created the secret for Codespaces for `MONGODB_URI`
- Ensure the features are added for **GitHub CLI**, **Azure CLI** and **MongoDB**
